This guide shows how to run Argus on a Kubernetes cluster. It is meant as a
solid starting point you adapt to your cluster — not a turnkey production
chart.

:::caution[The one rule that shapes everything]
Argus runs as **exactly one instance**. Its state is file-based with
non-concurrent read-modify-write; two active pods would corrupt it. There is no
HA or horizontal scaling, because there is no distributed lock and no shared
database that would make two active instances possible. Kubernetes here gives
you self-healing, declarative deploys and managed secrets/ingress, not scale.
:::

If you just want the simplest possible host, a VPS with the binary under
systemd is easier. Reach for Kubernetes when you already run a cluster and
want Argus to live alongside your other bots and ops tooling.

## Architecture on Kubernetes

| Concern | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Workload | `StatefulSet`, `replicas: 1` (never scaled) |
| State | one `ReadWriteOnce` PVC mounted at `ARGUS_HOME` |
| Config (`argus.yaml`, and `SOUL.md` — your organization's identity) | `ConfigMap`, seeded onto the PVC by an init container |
| Secrets (API keys, GitHub App) | `Secret` → env vars; the App **PEM** mounted as a file |
| User table (`users.yaml`) | lives on the PVC, managed via `kubectl exec` |
| Networking | one HTTP front door (`daemon.http_addr`), exposed by path at the `Ingress` |

### What lives where, and why

Argus splits its files by a single question — *is it mutated at runtime?*

- **Declarative config — `argus.yaml`, `SOUL.md`.** Read once at boot, never
  written at runtime. `SOUL.md` carries your organization's identity into every
  model call. Keep them in Git, ship them via a `ConfigMap`, and let
  the init container copy them onto the PVC (overwrite on every boot).
  Changing `SOUL.md` requires a **pod restart** to reload.
- **Secrets.** Provider keys and GitHub App credentials go in a `Secret` and
  are injected as **environment variables**. `argus.yaml` references them
  with the `env(VAR_NAME)` syntax, which resolves from the process
  environment — so **you do not need a `.env` file in the pod**. The GitHub
  App **private key** is the exception: `private_key_path` reads a file, so
  mount it from a `Secret`.
- **Runtime state — `users.yaml`, `MEMORY.md` (the summary Argus curates across
  sessions), `context/`, `audit.log.jsonl`, `reports/`, `cache/`.** Owned by the
  PVC. The init container never overwrites these.

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster (a single-node cluster is fine).
- An Ingress controller (e.g. ingress-nginx) and TLS — **the GitHub webhook
  must be reachable on a public HTTPS URL**. [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io)
  is the easy path to certificates.
- The official Argus image. You **do not build it yourself** — pull it from
  `ghcr.io/argusappsec/argus`:

  ```sh
  docker pull ghcr.io/argusappsec/argus:latest
  ```

  It is **batteries-included**: `argus` plus every binary its Tools shell out
  to — `git` (required, for cloning), `semgrep`, `gitleaks` and `osv-scanner`
  — so the GitHub pull-request review channel works out of the box with no
  derived image or sidecar. The image runs as nonroot (uid `65532`) and exposes
  a single HTTP front door on `:8080` — the daemon serves every configured HTTP
  channel (the GitHub webhook at `/webhooks/github`, MCP at `/mcp`) plus its
  `/healthz` probe on that one port. It is published multi-arch for
  `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` with provenance and SBOM attestations.

  **Which tag to run:**

  | Tag | Source | Use it when |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `latest` | the newest stable `v*` release | you want the recommended stable image (prereleases never move it) |
  | `vX.Y.Z`, `vX.Y`, `vX` | a specific `v*` git tag | you want to pin to an exact release for reproducible deploys |
  | `edge` | every push to `main` | you want the bleeding edge — continuous dogfooding of the latest daemon before it is tagged |

  Pin to a semver tag in production; reach for `edge` only if you deliberately
  want to track `main`.

## Step 1 — Author the seed config locally

`argus init` is interactive, so run it **on your laptop** (the local loop is
supported) to produce `argus.yaml` and `SOUL.md`:

```sh
argus init           # pick provider, enter the API key, run the SOUL interview
```

Keep the generated `argus.yaml` and `SOUL.md`, but make `argus.yaml` point at
env vars rather than inline secrets:

```yaml
# argus.yaml (the version you ship to the cluster)
default_model: gemini-2.5-pro
providers:
  gemini:
    type: gemini
    api_key: env(GEMINI_API_KEY)
daemon:
  socket: ~/.argus/argusd.sock
  http_addr: :8080            # the single HTTP front door
  max_concurrent_sessions: 4
codehosts:
  github:                     # outbound App identity: clone + call the API
    type: github
    app_id: env(GITHUB_APP_ID)
    private_key_path: /etc/argus/github_app.pem
channels:
  github:                     # inbound webhook binding
    type: github
    webhook_secret: env(GITHUB_SECRET_WH)
    auto_enroll: true
  mcp:
    type: mcp
```

:::note[Config v2 (0.3.0)]
The integration surface is split into `codehosts:` (outbound App credentials)
and `channels:` (inbound transport bindings), and the daemon owns a single front
door under `daemon.http_addr`. There is **no `installation_id`** — Argus derives
the acting installation from each webhook event (and per repository for
on-demand reviews), so installing the App on more organizations needs zero
config change. The old top-level `github:` / `mcp:` keys, `installation_id`, and
per-channel `addr` are **hard startup errors** whose message names the
replacement — there is no dual-read or migration shim.
:::

## Step 2 — ConfigMap (seed) and Secrets

```sh
# Declarative config seed (versioned in Git, GitOps-friendly)
kubectl create configmap argus-seed \
  --from-file=argus.yaml=./argus.yaml \
  --from-file=SOUL.md=./SOUL.md \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml > argus-seed.configmap.yaml

# Secrets injected as env vars
kubectl create secret generic argus-secrets \
  --from-literal=GEMINI_API_KEY=... \
  --from-literal=GITHUB_APP_ID=... \
  --from-literal=GITHUB_SECRET_WH=...

# GitHub App private key, mounted as a file
kubectl create secret generic argus-github-pem \
  --from-file=github_app.pem=./github_app.pem
```

:::tip
For GitOps, encrypt these with [Sealed Secrets](https://sealed-secrets.netlify.app)
or wire up [External Secrets](https://external-secrets.io) instead of
committing them.

`SOUL.md` carries org details (stack, infra, escalation contact). If you would
rather not have it in a ConfigMap, put it in a `Secret` and mount `/seed` from
there — the mechanism is identical.

## Step 3 — StatefulSet, Service, Ingress

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: argus
spec:
  serviceName: argus
  replicas: 1                       # never scale: two writers corrupt the state
  selector:
    matchLabels: { app: argus }
  template:
    metadata:
      labels: { app: argus }
    spec:
      securityContext:
        fsGroup: 65532              # let the nonroot image write the PVC
      initContainers:
        - name: seed
          image: busybox:1.37        # just needs sh + cp + test
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
          args:
            - |
              mkdir -p "$ARGUS_HOME"
              # config is declarative → always re-applied from the ConfigMap
              cp /seed/argus.yaml "$ARGUS_HOME/argus.yaml"
              cp /seed/SOUL.md    "$ARGUS_HOME/SOUL.md"
              # users.yaml is runtime state → never seeded here
          env:
            - { name: ARGUS_HOME, value: /data/.argus }
          volumeMounts:
            - { name: data, mountPath: /data/.argus }
            - { name: seed, mountPath: /seed, readOnly: true }
      containers:
        - name: argus
          image: ghcr.io/argusappsec/argus:latest
          args: ["daemon"]
          env:
            - { name: ARGUS_HOME, value: /data/.argus }
          envFrom:
            - secretRef: { name: argus-secrets }
          ports:
            - { name: http, containerPort: 8080 }   # the single front door
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet: { path: /healthz, port: http }
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet: { path: /healthz, port: http }
          volumeMounts:
            - { name: data, mountPath: /data/.argus }
            - { name: pem,  mountPath: /etc/argus, readOnly: true }
      volumes:
        - name: seed
          configMap: { name: argus-seed }
        - name: pem
          secret:
            secretName: argus-github-pem
            items:
              - { key: github_app.pem, path: github_app.pem }
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata: { name: data }
      spec:
        accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
        storageClassName: retain-sc       # a StorageClass with reclaimPolicy: Retain
        resources:
          requests: { storage: 10Gi }
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: argus
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  selector: { app: argus }
  ports:
    - { name: http, port: 8080, targetPort: http }
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: argus
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts: [argus.example.com]
      secretName: argus-tls
  rules:
    - host: argus.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /webhooks/github    # GitHub App webhook → must be public
            pathType: Prefix
            backend: { service: { name: argus, port: { name: http } } }
          - path: /mcp                # drop this path to keep MCP internal
            pathType: Prefix
            backend: { service: { name: argus, port: { name: http } } }
```

Both channels sit behind the one front-door port; **exposure is a routing
decision at the Ingress**, not a matter of separate listeners. Publish
`/webhooks/github` (the GitHub App must reach it) and keep MCP internal by
omitting the `/mcp` path — reach MCP via the in-cluster Service or a
port-forward. Leave `/healthz` unrouted; it is for in-cluster probes.

Point the GitHub App's webhook URL at `https://argus.example.com/webhooks/github`.

:::note[Upgrading from 0.2.x]
The webhook path changed from `/webhook` to `/webhooks/github`. Update the
GitHub App's webhook URL to match, or deliveries will 404.
:::

## Step 4 — Bootstrap users

`users.yaml` starts empty. Possession of the local socket is admin — whoever can
reach the daemon's Unix socket already controls the host it runs on, so Argus
treats that access as proof of ownership rather than asking for a credential it
could not protect anyway. The first operator therefore administers the daemon
over `kubectl exec`:

```sh
kubectl exec -it argus-0 -- argus user add davide --role admin --email davide@example.com
kubectl exec -it argus-0 -- argus user mcp-token add davide
```

:::note
Only **Persons** — the humans Argus recognizes — are bootstrapped here. The
`github-app` **Service principal**, the non-human actor that automatic
pull-request reviews are attributed to, is **synthesized** by the GitHub channel
from the fact of being configured: there is no service row to provision and no
`argus service` step. (Not to be confused with a Kubernetes `Service`, which
appears in the manifests above.)
:::

:::caution[Security]
In this model, anyone who can `kubectl exec` into the pod is an Argus admin.
Lock down `exec` with Kubernetes RBAC the same way you would protect SSH to a
host.
:::

## Step 5 — Backups

A PVC is **not** a backup — a disk or zone failure loses it. Protect the
runtime state off-cluster:

- Use `reclaimPolicy: Retain` on the StorageClass so deleting the PVC does
  not destroy the underlying disk.
- Schedule **off-cluster backups** with [Velero](https://velero.io) or CSI
  `VolumeSnapshot`s. Prioritize `audit.log.jsonl` (append-only, compliance).
- Do **not** mount the `ReadWriteOnce` PVC from a second backup pod on
  another node — it conflicts with the daemon. Use storage-layer snapshots
  or an in-pod sidecar.

Because `argus.yaml` and `SOUL.md` come from Git and secrets from your secret
store, a PVC loss only costs the accumulated state (`users.yaml`, memory,
context, audit log, reports) — which is exactly what the backups cover.

## Updating configuration

- **`argus.yaml` / `SOUL.md`:** edit in Git, re-apply the ConfigMap, and
  **restart the pod** (`kubectl rollout restart statefulset/argus`). With
  Flux, a ConfigMap-hash annotation or [Reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader)
  rolls the pod automatically.
- **Secrets:** update the `Secret` and restart the pod.
- **Users:** `kubectl exec` as in Step 4 — no restart needed.
