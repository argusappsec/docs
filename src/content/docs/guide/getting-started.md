Argus runs as a single long-lived daemon per organization. The CLI is
deliberately scoped to **setup and administration** — you talk to Argus
through its channels (TUI chat, GitHub, MCP), you don't execute it as a
scanner.

## Install

### From source

Requirements: **Go 1.26+**. The repo pins its toolchain with
[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) (see `.mise.toml`):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/argusappsec/argus.git && cd argus
mise install     # optional: pins go + golangci-lint versions
make build       # builds the ./argus binary
```

Scanner binaries (`semgrep`, `gitleaks`, `osv-scanner`) are optional but
recommended — install them on the daemon host and run `argus doctor` to check
what's available.

### Container image

The official image is **batteries-included**: the scanners ship inside, on
both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

```sh
docker run -it -v argus-data:/data -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/argusappsec/argus
```

- `ghcr.io/argusappsec/argus:latest` — latest release
- `ghcr.io/argusappsec/argus:edge` — every push to `main`

State lives under `ARGUS_HOME` (defaults to `/data/.argus` in the image), so
mount a volume at `/data` to keep it. Port `8080` is the single HTTP front
door (webhooks + MCP). The image's entrypoint runs `argus daemon`; for the
interactive setup commands below, exec into the container or run them with
the same volume mounted.

For running on a cluster, see [Kubernetes deployment](/guide/deployment/kubernetes/).

## Bootstrap

```sh
./argus init     # interactive: provider, API key, instance name, guided SOUL
./argus doctor   # verify dependencies and configuration
./argus          # opens the chat (same as `argus chat`)
```

:::note[A model is not required to start]
`argus init` sets Argus up to reason on its own behalf, which needs an LLM
provider. It is not the only way to run Argus: with no provider configured the
daemon starts as a **toolbox** and serves its scanners, your organization's
knowledge and its skills to the AI tool you already use, which does the
reasoning itself. That path skips `init` — see
[Deployment shapes](/guide/deployment-shapes/) for the handful of lines of
configuration it takes instead.
:::

`init` walks you through:

1. **Provider** — Gemini, or any server speaking the OpenAI-compatible
   protocol (hosted service or local runtime), with presets that fill in the
   base URL. The API key can live inline in the config or come from the
   environment (`GEMINI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`), and an endpoint that
   needs no key doesn't ask for one. See
   [LLM providers](/guide/llm-providers/) for what Argus requires from a model.
2. **Instance name** — how you'll address Argus ("Argus" by default, or a
   persona of your own — even multi-word).
3. **SOUL** — your organization's identity, captured by a guided interview:
   profile, stack, and risk tolerance. Every model call carries it, so reviews reflect
   *your* context. Answer briefly; every line should be able to change a
   decision.

You don't need to start a daemon before chatting: if no daemon is listening
on the socket, the TUI spawns one inside its own process and tears it down on
exit. For a permanent, multi-channel instance, run `argus daemon` (or the
container image, whose default command is exactly that).

## Connect channels

- **GitHub** — `./argus codehost setup` onboards a GitHub App and webhook
  channel; pull-request reviews then fire automatically. See
  [GitHub channel](/guide/channels/github/).
- **MCP** — mint a token with `argus user mcp-token create` and point your
  AI tool at the daemon's `/mcp` endpoint. This is the channel a toolbox is
  reached on, and it works the same on a colleague. See
  [MCP channel](/guide/channels/mcp/).

## Command reference

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `argus` | Opens the interactive chat (default UX) |
| `argus chat` | Open an interactive chat with the Argus agent |
| `argus init` | Interactive bootstrap: provider, API key, instance name, and `SOUL.md` |
| `argus codehost setup` | Onboard a GitHub code host + webhook channel |
| `argus doctor` | Check that dependencies and configuration are ready, and report which deployment shape this installation runs as |
| `argus user add/ls/rm/grant` | Manage **Persons** — the people Argus recognizes, each of whom may sign in from several places (`~/.argus/users.yaml`) |
| `argus user mcp-token create/revoke` | Manage MCP bearer tokens |
| `argus skill ls` / `argus skill rm <name>` | Manage agent skills |
| `argus daemon` | Run the Argus daemon (`argusd`) |

## Where state lives

Everything is file-based under `~/.argus/` (or `ARGUS_HOME`):

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `argus.yaml` | Configuration — see [Configuration](/guide/configuration/) |
| `SOUL.md` | Organization identity, injected into every model call |
| `MEMORY.md` | What Argus remembers across sessions — bounded, so it stays cheap on every call |
| `context/*.md` | Topical knowledge base, loaded on demand |
| `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | User-curated skill bundles |
| `users.yaml` | The Persons Argus recognizes, and their role grants |
| `argusd.sock` | The daemon's Unix socket |

:::caution[One instance per organization]
Argus's state is file-based with non-concurrent read-modify-write, so never run
two daemons against the same `ARGUS_HOME` — they would corrupt it.
:::

## Upgrading from 0.2.x

Configuration moved to v2: the legacy top-level `github:` / `mcp:` keys,
`installation_id`, and per-channel `addr` now **fail startup** with an error
naming the replacement (`codehosts:` / `channels:`, and the single HTTP front
door). Operators with an existing GitHub App must also change its webhook URL
from `/webhook` to `/webhooks/github`.
